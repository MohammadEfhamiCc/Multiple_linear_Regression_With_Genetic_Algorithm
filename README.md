# Multiple_linear_Regression_With_Genetic_Algorithm
training the parameters of a Multiple Linear Regression using Genetic Algorithm.
this source code has a general use,you could use it with your own dataset, the dataset file that has been uploaded, was the dataset for one of my final project for one of my courses that i took in the university.
i provided enough comment for the source code that you could easily understand what each part does.
feel free to use, change and modify this program, any changes that get to me with pull request would be welcome.
and at the end feel free to ask related questions from me,
for running this program: python Multiple_linear_Regression -g 50 -k 3
-g means the termination condition of this program, that if reach 50 generation it would stop,
-k means the parameter of tournament selection.
